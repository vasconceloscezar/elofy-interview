## Set up
This repo was created using mainly [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation) and [React](https://reactjs.org), on the `backend` and `frontend` folders respectivly. 

### Dependencies 
To run this project, we need [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) installed. PHP and MySQL can be installed with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). 

Create a database and change the name on the `.\backend\.env` file. 

### Start servers

Open two terminals in the root folder of this repo. 

To start the server run these commands: 

```ps
~ cd backend
~ php artisan serve
```
By default the server will run in the :8000 port. 


For the client terminal run the following: 

```ps
~ cd frontend
~ npm run start
```

With everything running you can access the [frontend](http://localhost:3000)
